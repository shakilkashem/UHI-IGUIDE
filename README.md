# Modeling the relationship between urban tree canopy, land cover, and land surface temperature

This exercise first shows some exploratory tasks to model land surface temperature and tree canopy to explore Urban Heat Island. It also lays out an initial modeling approach that combines exploratory data analysis with KNN regresson and decision tree models to better understand patterns of the data and for prediction purposes in the R environment. It is created for the IGUIDE platform.
